    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The [uecc_part1_trace.ipynb](uecc_part1_trace.ipynb) notebook was written to show how to find and exploit side-channel leakage in the [micro-ecc library](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer/tree/develop/hardware/victims/firmware/crypto/micro-ecc) library using Arm trace and [TraceWhisperer](https://github.com/newaetech/tracewhisperer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of what makes that notebook long is dealing with the jitter that's inherent to trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's not explicitely presented as such, the notebook essentially deals with the jitter by using SAD (Sum of Absolute Differences) to re-align the traces. There, the SADs are computed in software. But Husky can do SAD in hardware (and it's *much* faster than software-based SAD).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time that uecc_part1_trace.ipynb was written, it wasn't possible to combine trace and SAD. But with the addition of sequenced triggers, it is now.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook carries out what is essentially the same attack as uecc_part1_trace.ipynb, but using SAD instead of Arm trace to find the leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook and the original uecc_part1_trace.ipynb are similar and independent of one another, but uecc_part1_trace.ipynb has more explanations on the attack and the setting up of trace. It also explores leakage at various points, whereas this notebook focuses on just one area of leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, while uecc_part1_trace.ipynb can be run with ChipWhisperer-Pro and PhyWhisperer (running TraceWhisperer FW), this notebook **requires** CW-Husky (for its sequenced trigger capability)."
